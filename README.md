# Machine Learning & Predictions

Welcome to the ML repository! This project showcases my work in the fields of Machine Learning, CNN, and Predictive Modeling.

## Key Features

- **Data Mining:** Uncover hidden patterns, trends, and relationships in datasets.
- **Analysis:** Perform in-depth analysis to derive meaningful insights and draw conclusions.
- **Visualizations:** Create compelling visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
- **Machine Learning:** Create effective ML models to make predictions and drive business insights.
- **Deep Learning:** Deployed deep learnng models, such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** [Python; R]

## Projects

Explore the following projects within this repository:
